# Series 6
Everything related to [Open Source Malaria](http://opensourcemalaria.org/) (OSM) Series 6. 

The starting point is a series of molecules known as the marinoquinolines, led by the group of Carlos Roque Duarte Correia at the University of Campinas in Brazil. The series displays good potency, with an unknown mechanism of action.

The [wiki](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series6/wiki) describes the background and where the project is up to.

For new things and things under investigation, look at active Issues (link above).

For a description of the first OSM series, and of the general approach taken by OSM, read [the first OSM paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00086).
